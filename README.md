## Roll the dice

Simulate the results of rolling dice. Roll a six-sided die by default, or roll a custom die of up to one-hundred sides.

## Installation

Roll-It's latest stable release (version 2.1.1) is available via the [elementary OS] AppCenter.

[![Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/badge.svg)][AppCenter link]

There is currently no stable release for the GTK4/libadwaita rewrite (version 3.0.0).

Any version distributed elsewhere is not provided nor supported by me.

## Building

Roll-It 3.0.0 has been rewritten for GTK4 and libadwaita, aligning more with GNOME's HIG. This version is under active development, although there are still plans to build GTK4 Roll-It on the elementary OS platform in the future.

### Flatpak

If you would like to build and hack on Roll-It, it is highly recommended to use [GNOME Builder](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder/).

Manual build instructions to come later.
